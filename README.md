K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping subgroups or clusters. The goal of K-means is to group data points that are similar to each other into the same cluster while keeping dissimilar points in different clusters.

In the initial section of the code, the clustering method is defined, with the user specifying the number of clusters as 5 based on the input graph visualization. However, if the number of clusters in a given file is unknown, the subsequent part of the code can be employed to determine it. The bar graph generated by this section will display various numbers of clusters, and the one with the highest value indicates the most suitable number of clusters.

I have applied the code using the "data_clustering.txt" file, and I encourage you to experiment with it using the "data_quality.txt" file.
